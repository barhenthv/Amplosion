    <h3>The Adventures of Lord Waffles and Rascal</h3>
    <p>Lord Waffles and Rascal had been friends for as long as they could remember. Though a dog and a turtle may seem like an unlikely pairing at first blush, they quickly found their shared interests when they first met at the local watering hole. The watering hole was a local spot that every animal came to quench their thirst, say hi to their friends, and have some fun.</p>

    <p>Lord Waffles loved to go to the watering hole to chase the geese, he credited this exercise with his youthful appearance. It was more likely that he was only two years old, and is just youthful in general. Rascal, a much slower animal, watched in amazement as Lord Waffles zipped after the geese. You see, Rascal didn't much like the geese, because they were grumpy and mean to him, but he lacked the speed to get back at them, so he was happy to see this cunning dog ruffling their feathers a bit.</p>
    
    <p>Eventually Lord Waffles went to lay down in the shade, quite tired from his shenanigans. In the other direction, Rascal saw the geese grumpily march off to a secluded patch of land in the water, clearly unimpressed with what transpired.</p>
    
    <p>Now that Lord Waffles was laying down, Rascal saw this as his opportunity to greet him and maybe make a new friend. He had been trying to be more outgoing as of late, after all. So at the speed of an ant rushing to work, Rascal lumbered his way over to the shaded area.</p>
    
    <p>After 37 minutes, he made it to Lord Waffles. Somewhat exhausted himself now, he exclaimed "Nice to meet you, I'm Rascal!"</p>
    
    <p>Being in somewhat of a sleepy daze, Lord Waffles looked around drearily before noticing the tiny green turtle. "Oh hi! It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I'm Lord Waffles!"</p>
    
    <p>"Wow, that's quite a name!" Rascal replied enthusiastically. "How did you get that name? Is it of Celtic origin?"</p>
    
    <p>"I don't know what that means!" Lord Waffles said, confused. "But I've always been called Waffles, it's even on my birth certificate. However, after a ferocious, days-long pie eating contest I was granted dominion over a small region of Southern France, so I'm a Lord now!"</p>
    
    <p>"Wow, a Lord! I'm just a turtle. If I was a Lord, would I be a Lortle?" Rascal thought out loud. A passerby stared at him judgmentally before continuing walking.</p>
    
    <p>"Oh, absolutely you would. Anyway, Lord Waffles is a bit of a mouthful, not unlike waffles themselves!" he said, rolling around in the grass at his own joke. "So let's drop the whole Lord thing and be friends. You can call me Waffles, heck even Waff for short!"</p>
    
    <p>"I don't think I'm cool enough to pull off saying Waff, so I'm just going to go with Waffles. But oh my, did that talk about pies earlier ever make me hungry. It's been years since I had a pie."</p>
    
    <p>"WHAT?! A weekly pie is a part of every dog's balanced diet. Heck, it's how we get all our fruits! What a travesty!"</p>
    
    <p>Rascal took a moment to chew on these words, in absence of the pie itself. He realized Waffles was right, and there's been a pie-shaped hole in his life ever since he swallowed the last crumb of his last pie. He smiled, remembering how delicious that blueberry pie was. Even though it was many moons ago that he gobbled it like a ferocious pigeon, he could still vividly picture its flaky exterior and beautifully blue interior.</p>
    
    <p>"Say, what's your favorite pie, Waffles?"</p>
    
    <p>"Want to say each of our favorites on three?" Waffles replied, somewhat scared to announce his preference first. There was a lot of judgment in the dog kingdom if cherry cobbler pie wasn't your favorite. Oddly specific.</p>
    
    <p>"Okay!" Rascal answered happily.</p>
    
    <p>"1‚Ä¶"</p>
    
    <p>"2‚Ä¶"</p>
    
    <p>"3‚Ä¶"</p>
    
    <p>"BLUEBERRY!" they both exclaimed in unison. A beetle eating a blueberry scuttled away, fearful of his lunch being stolen by the unlikely duo.</p>
    
    <p>"Did we just become best friends?" Waffles chimed with a glimmer in his eye.</p>
    
    <p>"YUP!" Rascal hooted.</p>
    
    <p>They continued to laugh over their shared annoyances with the local uppity geese. Slowly the mood grew somber, and they realized the pie situation was dire! They absolutely needed to solve this issue in order to restore the missing piece in Rascal's life. </p>
    
    <p>Rascal mentioned that he heard of a lady down the street that sold pies they could look at. Waffles immediately disapproved of this idea, for the lady had questionable sanitary practices for her business, and on top of that the pies were not that great.</p>
    
    <p>No, the only pie that would do in the case of someone who has yet to have flaky crumble touch their lips for years would be a fresh cake. Made fresh. With fresh ingredients. </p>
    
    <p>"Where would we even get blueberries?" wondered Rascal.</p>
    
    <p>"I know just the place! My uncle has a farm, and he has a huge blueberry field there!" Waffles realized with excitement, pointing a paw up in the air in an attempt to make a 'Eureka!' pose. The lack of maneuvarable toe beans made this pose fall flat, but Rascal understood what he was going for and supported his friend anyway.</p>
    
    <p>Waffles' uncle, the Dutchy of Scone was an accomplished canine who over the decades constructed an impressive farm, consisting of an array of fruits and vegetables. He was a kind family dog, and loved to help out when he could. However he did not pay his taxes.</p>
    
    <p>Excited for their journey, they both looked in the direction of the geese and stuck their tongues out in unison before em<em>barking</em> on their journey. With a swift wag of his tail, Waffles launched Rascal onto back and the journey began.</p>
    
    <p class="intermission">üê∂üê¢</p>
    
    <p>After a few minutes of travel, Waffles could sense nervousness coming from Rascal. It was as if a nervous purple aura fell upon them. </p>
    
    <p>"What is it, buddy?" he said as he looked back, concerned.</p>
    
    <p>"If I take one more step, it'll be the furthest away from home I've ever been," he said, looking into the distance as the field of wheat waved in the wind.</p>
    
    <p>"Come on, Rascal," Waffles said with a warm smile, placing a paw on the turtle's shell as a few crows cawed. "I'm the one taking the steps anyway, so you're fine!"</p>
    
    <p>Their journey continued without a hitch, as the two enjoyed beautiful views as they progressed. Sunsets like Rascal had never seen before, and views to far off lands that not even Waffles had taken in before. They were both having the time of their lives, and their friendship strengthened further as they experienced it all together.</p>
    
    <p>However, it wasn't long before they encountered their first hurdle. With the blueberry patch in distant view, they thought their treasure was within reach, but something terrifying stood between them and their amino-acid rich friends.</p>
    
    <p>An old, decrepit wooden suspension bridge spanned a scary ravine and stood in their way. A shiver rolled down the spine Rascal would have if he wasn't a turtle.</p>
    
    <p>"Oh this old thing? It's not as bad as it looks. The only issue is that my uncle is a tiny dog, and I'm one of the bigger dogs in our family. It can support me, but the ropes are old enough that it can't support a feather more! Maybe we should turn around, and make a raspberry pie instead?"</p>
    
    <p>"No, Waffles, I have my heart set on a scrumptious pastry, not some computer."</p>
    
    <p>Rascal looked around, pondering as to what could be done. Could Waffles wrap him up in his tail, spin around really fast, and then launch him across the ravine? Perhaps put him in his mouth, and whip him like a frisbee into the blueberry pasture?</p>
    
    <p>He shook his head as he pictured him not quite making it, instead hitting the far side of the ravine and tumbling below. He pictured landing safely in the water, and making friends with a kind man named Shisui at the bottom before he hopped back into the salty waters and adjusting to his life as a leatherback sea turtle. This was not the life he wanted.</p>
    
    <p>And then he saw it.</p>
    
    <p>Not too far to their left was a patch of stringy, reed-like plants. </p>
    
    <p>"Waff, let's go over to those plants and have you yank a bunch out. Then I can craft them into some ropes. You see, I watch a lot of Primitive Technology on TurtleTube and I'm the best turtle in our family at fashioning rope. With that I should be able to repair the aging ropes on the bridge, which should let us cross safely!"</p>
    
    <p>With a bark and a cheer they scuttered off to the plants, where Lord Waffles earned his title by yanking out many a reed with his strong teeth, depositing them in a tidy pile in front of Rascal. </p>
    
    <p>Rascal quickly got to work, his little turtle fingers flashing like lightning as they got to work. Fisherman's knots, ballerina knots, New Zealand reverse buckler knots, this was really a who's who of fancy knots as the pile began to take shape.</p>
    
    <p>Within a few minutes, they had the necessary supplies. </p>
    
    <p>"I'm just going to take a little nap while you fix up the bridge," Rascal declared as he rolled over onto his back, immediately dozing off into a cute but noisy snoring symphony.</p>
    
    <p>Lord Waffles jumped into action, grabbing a bunch of knots and ropes in his mouth and shot over to the bridge with haste. There, he threw the ropes over the decrepit parts of the bridge, yanking the other end of the rope and securing it. </p>
    
    <p>Proud of his work, he took to several doggy hops as a test of the bridge's might. Thankfully it didn't so much as sway, this bridge could even support a small congregation of migrant penguins.</p>
    
    <p>He ran back to Rascal‚Äîwho was still very much asleep‚Äîand with one swift motion used his nose to boop him back onto all fours, which woke up Rascal with a startle. Waffles quickly launched him onto his back and darted over to the bridge, excited to show his best friend his handiwork.</p>
    
    <p>Rascal was more than impressed, and in fact barely recognized the bridge before him if it wasn't for his famous apricot knots that adorned the bridge. You see, he invented those knots himself, realizing he could tie the rope around apricots in order to give the knots superior strength through the nutrients released by the fruit.</p>
    
    <p>"Well done, Waffles! This is incredible! Really top tier work! I'm actually excited to go across it now, rather than fearful. This is something to be proud of!" Rascal beamed.</p>
    
    <p>They confidently trotted across the bridge, peering over to see the fast-moving water below, but not fearful as the added ropes were spaced no more than twelve inches apart now, parallel to the bridge and fully inline with modern kingdom codes. You couldn't fall off this bridge if you wanted to!</p>
    
    <p>"Look Rascal! It's the blueberry field!" Waffles exclaimed as a sea of blue slowly revealed itself before them. It looked like a beautiful deep blue lake, one that had blueberries poured in it.</p>
    
    <p>Waffles sat Rascal down briefly so he could use some of the remaining reeds to fashion a basket they could use to collect the blueberries. Suffice to say, the artisanship on this basket was second to none, worthy of the immaculate blueberries that would soon fill it up.</p>
    
    <p>They took a moment to look around and scope out what blueberry bush would have the honor of joining their pie. Finally Rascal stuck out his little turtle hoof toward a magnificent bush that the late afternoon sun was shining upon. The bows of the bush looked so heavy with plump blueberries that it looked like it couldn't carry another blueberry more.</p>
    
    <p>Rascal was soon on Waffles' back, and climbed up atop his head to get to the higher blueberries on the bushes, and headbutted them down into the basket below. Occasionally one would boop the snoot of Waffles and they both giggled in the way only people who have picked blueberries together can.</p>
    
    <p>Light slowly started to drain from the sky, and they figured they had enough blueberries to make leftover pies for the days to come as well, so they decided to take their heavy basket home before it got late. </p>
    
    <p>"Thanks Scones!" Waffles yelled to his uncle.</p>
    
    <p>"Yes, thank you Mr. Scones!" Rascal yelled as well. Turtles were very polite, and found it important to properly express their gratitude.</p>
    
    <p>Content as cucumbers, and proud as plums, they looked toward their bridge and took their first step on the way home.</p>
    
    <p>But Waffles didn't feel the regular, warm gardening soil beneath his paw. In fact, he felt nothing as he tumbled forward, head over tail, head over tail, Rascal holding onto a tuft of hair for dear life, as they fell into a deep hole for what felt like minutes.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, they landed with a thud. Thankfully a few blueberries fell out of the basket on the way down and beat them to the bottom, creating a soft landing to cushion their fall with. Though now Waffles belly was a different shade of blue than it ever had been before, stained pieces of blueberries as a souvenir of their fall.</p>
    
    <p>"Excuse my language, but what in tarnation!" Rascal declared, looking around and hoping no other turtles heard his harsh words. "At least the blueberries are safe."</p>
    
    <p>Waffles was equally confused, and looked around trying to make sense of the situation.</p>
    
    <p>Finding nothing, he looked back at Rascal, dumbfounded. But before he could say anything,  he saw an enormous lizard march out from behind some trees. It was the largest animal Waffles had ever seen, and he had seen nothing like it before. </p>
    
    <p>Its neck was three times as long as its legs, but had a tiny tail. It must have been 100 feet tall.</p>
    
    <p>"R-r-rascal, is that‚Ä¶ is that a Brontosaurus?" Waffles stammered.</p>
    
    <p>Rascal, confused and thinking it was a joke, turned toward where Waffles was looking. It was not a joke.</p>
    
    <p>"That's actually an Apatosaurus, they've very commonly mistaken for one another. However that's still very much a cause for concern, why on earth are there dinosaurs here all of a sudden?!"</p>
    
    <p>Both of their sets of legs started dancing in a shiver as the large dinosaur noticed them and corrected its course to be walking toward them. It was laser-focused on the two friends, and with each step closer the ground shook harder.</p>
